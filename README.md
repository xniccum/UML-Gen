# UML-Gen
## Design


## Who Did What
Everyone alternated pair programming on Doolan's PC for the design and the first part of the implementation. Austin then started working on the automated testing once there was enough working code to test. Doolan and Davis then alternated on Doolan's PC finishing the project implementation and fixing bugs.

## Instructions
The main class is run with the paths to the class names as argument strings. The DOT file result can then be passed into GraphViz to generate the UML image.
